## What it does

This tool allows you to choose servers you wanna play on by blocking relays that you don't want using [iptables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables).

## Installation

Just clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/dom1torii/cs2serverpicker-linux.git` into any directory.

## How to use 

- `cd` to the directory you just cloned.
- Run `chmod +x cs2serverpicker.sh` to make script executable.
- Run the script with `sudo ./cs2serverpicker.sh` (sudo is important to change firewall rules)
